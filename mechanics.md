Interactions with the shared "row":

* Some cards could allow you to draw more than one card from the center row if it comes in multiples or if certain criteria are met.
* Some cards could allow you to "banish" a card from the center row when played or selected.
* Some cards could allow you to replace a card from the center row when played or selected.
* Some cards could allow you to force a player to take a specific card when played.
