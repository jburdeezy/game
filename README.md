# Justin's Game

I'm designing a game from scratch. I'm experimenting by creating the game using git, simple text and GitHub. Maybe some ruby scripts to produce playable prototypes. My hope is that my playtesters and fans will get to collaborate with me directly.

The following information about the game is set in stone:

1. It will be a card game.
2. It will be designed for 1v1 play.
3. It will not be a collectible card game a la Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh. That's a bad business model.

I'm exploring most of the other details about the game now. Over time, this list will evolve.

# How can I help?

Since this is a public repo, anyone can contribute. In the short term, this is probably not that meaningful. In the future, that probably means being able to fix typos, suggest a new card and more.

For the time being, the best way to help is to check out our [issue tracker](http://github.com/jburdeezy/game/issues) and response to any open questions with feedback, or open a new issue if you have a good idea.

# Currently Exploring

I am currently exploring a gameplay inspired by a variant of Magic: the Gathering called [Wizards Tower](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/257b). This means the game will have:

1. A shared central deck and discard pile used by all players
2. A shared "row" of cards that can be selected at the start of turn
3. A draw step that includes taking one card from the "row" and one card from the top of the shared deck, providing for some unknown information.
4. Some sort of combat-based system for defeating your opponent

I think there is some interesting design space that is unexplored by Magic in this varient, since this format is casual and fringe in popularity at best (though loads of fun). For example, there's no way to interact with the public row in Magic.

# Flavor

I'm currently thinking about setting the game in a futuristic world in which two combatants fight in a holographic computer simulation. Culturally, these matches are akin to boxing or other individual sports of our world: there are spectators and winners in these battles are held in high esteem. Like any good game, the game can evolve over time - meaning new cards, expansions and changes to gameplay.

Since this sport is so popular, many of the megacorporations that exist in this time have great interest in both advertising and influencing the outcome of a match. For example, if a player wins the match using a sponsored technology brings them great publicity. This could be a way to introduce the concept of "factions" or "colors" to the game.

The resource system might be something like "computer memory" to run "programs."

# To do

- We need a resource system.
- We need a combat system.
