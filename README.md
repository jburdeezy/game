# Justin's Game

I'm designing a game from scratch. I'm experimenting by creating the game using GitHub to both collaborate and produce prototypes. My hope is that my playtesters and fans will get to collaborate with me directly while we build the game.

My game is a non-collectible strategy card game for 2 players competing against each other. It is inspired by a Magic: the Gathering variant called (Wizards Tower)[http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/257b], which combines neat elements of deckbuilding and shared deck card games.

# How can I help?

Since this is a public repo, anyone can contribute. In the short term, this is probably not that meaningful. In the future, that probably means being able submit card ideas, fix typos or suggest improvements to the game balance and more.

For the time being, the best way to help is to check out our [issue tracker](http://github.com/jburdeezy/game/issues) and response to any open questions with feedback, or open a new issue if you have a good idea.

# Flavor

The game is set in a futuristic world in which two combatants fight in a holographic computer simulation. Culturally, these matches are akin to boxing or other individual sports of our world: there are spectators and winners in these battles are held in high esteem. Like any good game, the game can evolve over time - meaning new cards, expansions and changes to gameplay.

Since this sport is so popular, many of the megacorporations that exist in this time have great interest in both advertising and influencing the outcome of a match. For example, if a player wins the match using a sponsored technology brings them great publicity. These megacorporations encourage the use of their sponsored technology to aid in combat, which correspond to different strategies, synergies and the resource system.
