# Justin's Game

I'm designing a game from scratch. I know this much so far:

1. It will be a card game.
2. It will be designed for 1v1 play.
3. It will not be a collectible card game a la Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh. That's a bad business model.
4. I'm experimenting by creating the game using git, simple text and GitHub. Maybe some ruby scripts to produce playable prototypes. My hope is that my playtesters and fans will get to collaborate with me directly.

# Currently Exploring

I am currently exploring a gameplay inspired by a variant of Magic: the Gathering called [Wizards Tower](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/257b). This means the game will have:

1. A shared central deck and discard pile used by all players
2. A shared "row" of cards that can be selected at the start of turn
3. A draw step that includes taking one card from the "row" and one card from the top of the shared deck, providing for some unknown information.
4. Some sort of combat-based system for defeating your opponent

I think there is some interesting design space that is unexplored by Magic in this varient, since this format is casual and fringe in popularity at best (though loads of fun). For example, there's no way to interact with the public row in Magic.

# To do

-[ ] We need a resource system.
-[ ] We need a combat system.
-[ ] We need a flavorful theme.
