# Justin's Game

I'm designing a game from scratch. I know this much so far:

1. It will be a card game.
2. It will be designed for 1v1 play.
3. It will not be a collectible card game a la Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh. That's a bad business model.
4. I'm experimenting by creating the game using git, simple text and GitHub. Maybe some ruby scripts to produce playable prototypes. My hope is that my playtesters and fans will get to collaborate with me directly.
